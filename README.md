# HomeLink – Smart Home Essentials

## Description
HomeLink is a modern and responsive web application that allows users to explore, organize, and manage smart-home devices from a single interface.  
The project includes dynamic device listings, a lightbox gallery, real-time room summaries, and form validation.  
All data is handled locally in the browser using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
